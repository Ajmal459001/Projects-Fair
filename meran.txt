----------------HTML----------------

code . -->open vscode in terminal
HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language

1. Markup Language : Set of rules used to define a document should contain.
2. HTML : Used to display contents in webpage.
3. HTML documents consist of html elements
    - html elements : <starting-tag>contents</ending-tag>
4. HTML structure
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Webpage Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            Contents to be displayed in webpage
        </body>
    </html>
5. HTML 5 ---> "!"
6. Basic Tags
    - Heading : h1-h6 Tags
    { Non-executing Tag : Ctrl+/ (Comments) }
    - Paragragh : p Tag
    - Bold content : b Tag
    - Italics : em Tag (Emphizie) or i tag
    - Highlight : mark Tag
    - Strike : s Tag
    - Superlative : sup Tag
    - Subscript : sub Tag
    - Links : a Tags (anchor tag)(open in the same tab)
    - To break line : br Tags
    - Ordered list : ol Tag, li Tag
    - Unordered list : ul Tag, li Tag
    - Description list : dl Tag, dt Tag, dd Tag
    - Table : table tag(border), thead tag, tr tag, tbody, td & th tag
    - Image : img tag
    - Video : video tag
    - Embedding content : iFrame tag
    - Container tags(block element)
        - div tag
        - section tag
        - article tag
    - User inputs :
        - form tag
        - user inputs : input tags, radio Button(should group using name attribute to choose only one radio button among multiple radio buttons)
        - Button :
        - Checkbox : using input tag for selecting and deselecting multiple options.
7. Based on display value of tags in browser, We can classify tags
    - Block elements : it use entire width of the browser to display content in browser
        - ex : h1-h6 Tags, p tag, ol, ul, li list tags
    - Inline elements: it use only width of the content to display content in browser
        - ex : a tag, img tag

            - Encapsulation : 


        ---------JAVASCRIPT :  FRONTEND---------


    1. Used to provide behaviour to HTML elements
    2. Applying JS to HTML elements
        - Internal JS : js code in script tag
        - External JS : link an external js file using script tag
    3. DOM(Document Object Model) : tree structure using object correspondinng to a web page
    4. DOM methods
        - using tag : document.getElementByTagName("tag")
        - using id : document.getElementById("id")/id
        - using class : document.getElementByClass("Class")
        - using querySelector : document.querySelector("tag/#id/.class")
        - using querySelectorAll : document.querySelector("tag/#id/.class")
    5. Events : Triggered by user action, events occured in HTML elements 
        - Mouse related events : click,drag,drop....
        - Keyboard related events : key press down, key up, key down....
        - Touch related events 
    6. Handling Events in HTML : event = function-call() inside html element, behaviour change must define as a function in js
    7. Access/ update Content of an html element in JS
        - innerHTML / innerText property
    8. Permanent data storage in browser
        data will be stored permanently, data stored as key-value pair. type of both key and value must be 'string', to convert value to string - use JSON.stringify(value), to parse string data to normal type - JSON.parse(value)
            - Local storage : 
                - setItem(key,value) : used to store data to storage
                - getItem(key) : used to get value from storage
                - removeItem(key) : used to delete a value from storage
                - clear() : used to clear storage
            - Session storage : 
    9. Working Browser JS Runtime Environment
        - JavaScript Engine : it handle js execution, convert js code to code understand by browser Engine
            - Call Stack : used to keep track of currently executing functions, make sure each one finishes before moving to next. only one call stack in js engine thats is why it is known as Single Threaded Programming
                - can handle 2 types of Functions   
                    - synchronous function : functions executes without a delay
                    - Asynchronous function : functions executes with delay
                        - Callback Functions : Task Queue (Macro Task Queue) - like setTimeout / user events (click/drag...)
                        - Web APIs : stored in Micro task queue which is a priority queue 
            - Event Loop : It manages flow of the code, ensuring Asynchronous operations & user interaction run smoothly. 
            - Heap : storage for variable & object in JS
    10. Asynchronous function Handling in JS
        - Callback function : Nesting of CallbackFn will leads to Callback hell, that means js wont give any response for this kind of call.
        - Promise : Used to resolve Asynchronous function it will definitely gives you a response, A Promise can resolve in 2 types :
            - resolved state : if Asynchronous function call return a response then that state of promise is known as 'resolved state', to get response from resolved state we have to use 'then method' of promise
            - reject state : if Asynchronous function call return nothing after making the call that state is known as 'reject state', to get response from reject state we have to use 'Catch method' of promise
            - Async-Await Keyboards : To resolve promise much more easier, to avoid Callback from promise, if a function is Asynchronous then only we can use Await insdide the function
                - async keyword : makes a function return a promise
                - Await keyword : makes a function to wait for a promise
    11. API (Application Programming Interface) : used to communicate between Application using internet
        - Types of APIs : Based on different communication
            - REST / SOAP : client-server Application 
            - SOCKET : Web Chatting Application
            - GRAPHQL 
        - API Testing Tools
            - Postman
            - ThunderClient : Vs code extension
    12. URL : Unifrom Resource Locator
        - ex : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1
        - Base URL : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
        - URI : Unifrom Resource Indentifier - ex : users
        - Path Parameters : numbers associated in url
        - ex: https://www.google.com/search?q=yahoo&oq=yahoo&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg5MgYIAhBFGDkyBggDEC4YQNIBCDI1NzZqMGoxqAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
        - Query Parameters : are value after a questionMark(?) in url
    13. HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) : used to allow Application to make request via internet
        - HTTP request : client Application will make request
             - 2 parts 
                - Header part : to keep secret data
                - Body part : used to hold data(Binary/XML/JSON...) to be transfer from client - server 
        - HTTP Methods : 
            - GET : used to get / read data from an app
            - POST : create / store data
            - PUT : used to update data completely
            - PATCH : used to update data partially
            - DELETE : used to remove data
        - HTTP response : server Application provide response to client
            - To get response status of request, browser is using HTTP Response Status code
                - 1xx : Infromational
                - 2xx : Success
                - 3xx : Redirection 
                - 4xx : Client Error
                - 5xx : Server Error
    14. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation ) : is a data format used to transfer data from Application to other using internet
        - data stored as key-value pair, here 'key' must be always 'string' type
        - ex : "username":"Max Miller", "Age":39
    15. API Call in JS : AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) - methods to make API call using js
        - API call using 'XMLHttpRequest' (XHR)
            - XMLHttpRequest Class has predefined function & properties to make sending request & response between Application in internet
                - Object of XMLHttpRequest used to interact with server Application 
                - XMLHttpRequest Class properties
                    - readyState : returns a number which indicate state of a request(1-4), if readyState==4 then request recieves the response
                    - responseText : return a string that contains the response to the request as text 
                    - Status : return response status code of the request 
                - XMLHttpRequest Class methods 
                    - open() : used to Intialise a request 
                    - send() : sends the request
                - Events
                    - onreadyStatechange : event to occur whenever readyState changes  
            - Steps to make API call 
                1. create an object for XMLHttpRequest class
                2. Intialise the request using open method
                3. Send request
        - API call using 'fetch' method
            - fetch() function returns a Promise, then resolved response will get from 'then method' and reject response get from 'catch method' of promise
        - API Call using axios Library : Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser.
    16. JAVASCRIPT Modules : used to transfer data from one js file to another 
            - use import / export Statements
                - export Statements : used to share data from one js file to another, can used in 2 types
                    - using export default keyword : this keyword must be at the end of that file
                    - using export keyword : used to export multiple data from a single js file            
                - import Statements : used to use exported data from another js file, we can export data in 2 types
                    - import with curly braces : if data exported using 'export keyword'
                    - import without curly braces : if data exported using 'export default keyword'


---------REACT : Advanced FRONT END Application Library - META (FaceBook) ---------


    1. Basic React 
        - React App is a collection of different Libraries
        - React App is consist of different type of 'components', which is used to display contents in browser, in React app, all the components are arranged in a tree structure. Tree structure has a single parent node which is by default known as 'App component' , components are reusable. 
        - Pure JavaScript functions to built components, it return how to dispaly contents in browser. Pure function are capable of doing only one task with help of its arguements. function without side effects
        - Declarative approach 
        - Virtual DOM : Light weight memory representation of real DOM. 
        - Babel Library : used to dispaly contents in to browser
        - JSX (JavaScript XML) : JS extension for writing html code in JavaScript, used to display content in browser
            - Jsx element : ex: const heading = <h1> Heading </h1>
            - Rules for using JSX
                - Every JSX element must be inside a single tag. Parent tag can be any container tag (div,section,article etc ...) or react fragments ( <></> ) tag without name is known as react fragments. 
                - In JSX we have to use 'camel case' to write content : ex: fontSize
                - Every JSX code must have a closing tag. if a tag has contents then : <startingTag>contents</endingTag> , if a tag doesnot has content : <startingTag></endingTag> or we use self closing tag ( <startingTag/> ) as well
                - Instead of attribute 'Class' use 'className' in JSX
                - Instead of attribute 'for' use 'htmlFor' in JSX
                - In JSX , we can directly pass js code inside a curly braces. ex: {js code}
    2. React App Creation 
        - CRA (using create-react-app command) //execution time delay
        - Vite : tool for building web Application
            - Installing vite globally : npm i -g create-vite
            //npm create vite@latest
            //react 
            //JavaScript 
            - React App Creation using vitr :  
            - to run vite react project : npm run dev
            - to generate build folder to deploy react app using Netlify : npm run build
    3. File & Folder structure of react app using vite
        - package.json file : npm configuration file for the project
        - package-lock.json file : used to hold version of dependent package of the project
        - eslint.config.js file : js configuration file
        - .gitignore file : used to hold file & folder to be ignored while adding to git
        - node_modules folder : used to locally store dependent packages of the project , we generate node_modules folder with the help of command 'npm instal'
        - public folder : used to hold data that can be accessed by any part of the project.
        - index.html file : entry point of react Application, react app will display in index.html file
        - src folder : logic of react app is definded here 
            - main.jsx file : define the logic to render ( displaying in browser ) react app in html element with id as 'root'
                - createRoot() : lets you create a root to display React components inside a browser DOM node.
            - css file : used to define style for all components in react app
            //reconciliation
            - App.jsx file : used to create react root component
            - assets folder : used to hold media files used in react project 
    4. Components : are part of user interface. used to dispaly contents in browser, to create component create a js / jsx file with filename start with capital letter
        - create react components 2 types 
            - Functional based / Stateless  component : uses js Pure function to build component, function name must similar to its filename. function must return jsx code (rafce - react arrow function component export)
            - Class based / state full component : uses class to create component. class inherit react component class. render method in class used to return jsx. (rcc - react class component)
                - to create state. it has to call super method in its constructor to get its parent features. state is an object, where we can store value as key-value pairs, to update the state use a predefined method setState() pass its arguement as updated value of state.
        - Life Cycle Methods of React components
            - Mounting Phase : Putting JSX into DOM
                - constructor()
                - getDerivedStateFromProps()
                - render()
                - componentDidMount()
            - Updating Phase : When component updated
                - getDerivedStateFromProps()
                - shouldComponentUpdate()
                - render()
                - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
                - componentDidUpdate()
            - Unmounting Phase : Removing component from DOM
                - componentWillUnmount()
        - Difference class based vs functional based component

            Class Based Components                          Functional Based Components
        ----------------------------------------      ------------------------------------------
        1. using class to create, render method       1. using js pure function and return jsx
        must return jsx
        2. Statefull component                        2. Stateless component
        3. Hooks are not used                         3. Hooks are not used
        4. Need constructor to Intialise state        4. No need of constructor
        5. Life Cycle methods are available           5. Life Cycle methods are not available

    5. Data sharing in React Components 
         - Data can only be shared from parent to child : use 'props' object 
    6. Props : is a property of a component. it is an object used to transfer data from parent component to child component, parent data can be shared via child tag attribute. to access parent data in child we have to props. props used in the child component function arguement. props cannot be changed
    7. Conditional Rendering : used based on condition rendering jsx elements in browser, using if-else Statements (Ternary operator ?:) / if Statements ( && operator )
    8. List in React : use map array method. set key attribute to duplicating JSX element in a list 
    9. CSS styling in react : Different ways to apply css to JSX elements
        - Inline CSS : use style attrribute to apply style to jsx element, style must be as js object
            - syntax : style = {{cssProperty : value,...}}
        - Using External CSS : Define css style in an external css file. Link css file to component file using import Statements. We cannot import css file into a  variable in component file
            - import 'css file path'
        - Using CSS Module file : file with extension as .module.css is known as css 'module file', In this file we have to define style in class. To use module css file we have to import it to component file.
            - import variableName from 'module css file path', to apply in component, variableName.className
        - Important Css Styling Component Libraries
            - Material UI : npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled 
            - React Bootstrap : npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap, Choose bootstrap theme in order apply bootstrap properly in react project, use https://bootswatch.com/ for selecting theme. Download bootstrap.min.css and add that file inside project src folder. Import bootstrap.min.css file in main.jsx file of project.(import './bootstrap.min.css')
            - Tailwind CSS : npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer, npx tailwindcss init -p . use the guideline from the link : https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite
    10. Events Handling in React : syntax - event={function call}
        - Binding function without arguements : event={functionName}
        - Binding function with arguements : event={()=>functionName(argument) }
        - Binding function with arguements : event={(event)=>functionName(event) } 
    11. State in React : used to store data of a component. When state value changes component will re render (reconciliation)
    12. Hooks in React(launched in the version 16 of update) : predefined methods in react is known as hooks. Used to provide react component features to Functional Based component. All hooks names are starts with 'use' keyword. To use a hook in a functional component, it has to call the hook. 
        - Rules to use/call hooks to functional component
            - import hook in component file
            - to use hook in component call the hook in top level of component
            - Hooks cannot be Conditional
        - Based on react features there are different types of hooks are available
            - Built in Hooks    
                - useState(initial-value) hook : used to create state in functional component, this hook will return an array 2 arguements. first arguement will the state, second arguement is a function name generally used to update state. state updating function name must start with 'set'.
                -useEffect(CallbackFn,dependency) hook : used to apply side effects to the functionnal component. we can pass side effects in its first arguement as Callback function, we can also pass an optional dependency arguement to decide when to apply side effects in component
                    - dependency different values
                        - no value : side effects will apply to the component all the time, which leads to an infinite loop.
                        - empty array : side effects will apply to the component only at the time of loading the component in DOM
                        - [state/props/variable_name] : side effects will apply to the component not only at the time of loading of the component in DOM but also whenever the value of state / props /variable_name given in the dependency changes
                -useRef(intial-value) hook : is a React Hook that lets you reference a value that’s not needed for rendering. initial-value is optional in useRef hook, it will return an object with 'current' key
            - Custom Hooks : create js file to define a specific function for a special task. export the function from that file. function name must start with the 'use' keyword
            - useParams() : hook will return dynamic value of route associated with a component
            - useSelector() : hook used to select state from redux store
            - useDispatch() : hook used to dispatch action from a component 
            - useNavigate() : used to navigate / redirect from one component to another
            - useContext() : used to access context in component
    13. Form Handling in React : there are 2 ways to manage data inside the form by a component 
        - Controlled Components : are component which store form data inside its own state
        - Uncontrolled Components : component who access form data using its DOM elements reference 
        - preventDefault() : is automatically invoked when cancelable attribute value is true, then this function prevent is effect by setting it value as false
    14. Set up Path/url for component in React :use package react-router-dom
        - install react-router-dom : npm i react-router-dom
        - Steps to set up path/url for component
            1. Render the entire react app inside 'BrowserRouter' component of react-router-dom Library, provide this step inside main.jsx file 
            2. Inorder to set up path for component, make sure each component must be inside Routes Component of react-router-dom Library, provide this step inside App.jsx file
            3. To set up path for component use 'Route' component of react-router-dom Library. Route component has attributes like 'path' and 'element' inorder to setup route for component. All route component must be inside Route Component
        - Dynamic Routing : we can setup a dynamic  / changing value in url along : symbol , so react app will understand value with a : is dynamic part of this url.
        - To set up up Page not found url use path as * , its path must be set up at end of all url in react app
        - useNavigate hook : is return a function which capable of redirecting one page to another from  component
        - Link component is used to redirect from one page to another using jsx
    15. Higher Order Components (HOC) : are component whose props arguement will give another component, ex : Route component
    16. API Call in react : 
            - using Axios Library : npm i axios
            - To make Http request using axios : axios(config), axios.httprRequest() method
                - config : is a predefined object  with keys ( method,url,data,headers )
            - Http response using axios will always return object with predefined keys (data(server response),status)
            - Create a services Folder inside src of your react project
    17. Data sharing between components in react :
        - State Lifting : data sharing is using props. We will create a state in common parent of data to be shared components. share state updation function to one component and state to other component
        - REDUX : using state management library
        - Context API : used to share data from different components without using 'props'
            - This is in built feature of react to share data between any components without using props and avoid props drilling
            - We can share data from one component to another component using react context , this component purpose is to share data via context
            - Steps to perform data sharing using context API   
                - create a folder for holding context
                - create a component inside the folder for performing data share using context 
                - create a context inside the component and export the context, use 'creatContext' method
                - inside the component create data (state & state update function) to be shared via the context
                - context can share data using its 'Provider' property, as well as its 'value' property can share the data as object so that it can shre it its child child component
                - make context component as the 'root component' of our project (inside the main.jsx file wrap root component inside context component), then only project components become children of context component (to access project components inside context component it can use children props)
                - children props used to access all children of a component at the same time
                - useContext : to access data from context in component
                    - syntax : const {value} = useContext(context)


            --------- JSON SERVER CREATION ---------


    1. Create a server folder to store json file 
    2. Create a package.json (npm configuration file) file insdide server folder : use command - npm init -y 
    3. install json-server package in server folder to run json file , use command to install json-server : npm i json-server / to get json-server stable version use command : npm i json-server@0.17.4
    4. Create json (db.json) file for storing project data.
    5. To run json file and available in browser port use command in server folder : npx json-server db.json



            --------- JSON SERVER DEPLOYEMENT USING NODE JS ---------


    1. Create a index.js insdie server folder
    2. Update scripts key of package.json file with { "start" : "node index.js" } and remove test key from it
    3. Creaate .gitignore file, to add node_modules inside it
    4. Define steps to run db.json file using json-server in index.js
        - import json-server 
        - create a sever for media player app in order to run our server app
        - create a middleware to convert json data to js
        - create a port for executing our app
        - set up route / path db.json file so that client can make the request
        - use middleware , route inside the server 
        - run the server using the given port
        - to execute our app we have to use : node index.js in terminal, so that we can see the output in localhost:3000


            --------- REDUX - STATE MANAGEMENT TOOL ---------

    1. A JS library for predictable and maintainable global state management, And to avoid props drilling
    2. Redux consist of 2 packages
        - React-redux : Official React bindings for Redux, npm install react-redux 
        - Redux-Toolkit : The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development, npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
    3. Important API used redux
        - configureStore() : used to create store for redux. 
            - steps to create redux store in react app
                - create a folder redux logic in src folder
                - inside redux folder create a js file for creating redux store, call configureStore method and use reducers to hold the state to be shared / stored in store
            - To provide store to our react app use 'Provider' component of react-redux library. Provider component has 'store' attribute using it we can provide our store to react app. Inorder to do that make Provider component as the root component of our react app. Give these steps in main.jsx file
        - createReducer() : used to create reducers where we can store updated state inside store
        - createAction() : used to create action where we can define logic to updated state , output of action automatically return to reducer
        - createSlice() : used to combine action and reducer in a single file. return action and reducer - it accept initial state, slice name , object of reducers where we can use key as 'action name' and its value as 'reducer function' , reducer function has 2 arguement , first will always initial state of slice, second arguement is an object which contains data from dispatching action
            - steps slice for react app 
                - create js file for defining slice
                - createSlice method call where we have to define reducers as objects , its key act as action and its value act as reducer function it has minimum one arguement which gives slice state 
        - createAsyncThunk() : used to make Asynchronous call in an action in redux. It accept 2 arguements , first is action type string ("slice-name/action-name"), 2nd arguement is a callback function it can return promise. Its output can be 3 different types. pending state / fulfilled state / reject state. 'ExtraReducers' in slice can handle promise return action. Because it has define different cases to update slice state, based on promise output.
    4. Hooks used in Component for managing state using redux
        - useSelector(state=>state.reducer-name) : used to select state from store in a component 
        - useDispatch() : used to execute an action from a component. Hook will return a function that is capable of dispatching an action as its arguement when we call the function
            - action without arguement : dispatch-function(action-name())
            - action with arguement : dispatch-function(action-name(arg1,...)), to access arguement of action in slice reduce function it uses its second arguement which is an object with 2 key payload and type. payload will give the arguement from action dispatched by a component 


            --------- SERVER / BACKEND TECHNOLOGIES ---------

            --------- MONGODB - DATABASE ---------


    1. DB are used to store and manage data permanently (MongoDB, SQL, MSAccess, Oracle etc..)
    2. MongoDB - Is a NoSQL DB. Document Oriented DB, where data are stored as JSON format ({"Key":value}), It stored in memory as BSON format.
    3. Collection : are used to store multiple JSON documents, to create a collection use its naming convention as always starts with small letter and it should be a plural
    4. Difference between SQL & MongoDB
                SQL                                             MongoDB
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        1. Relational SQL DB                            1. Document Oriented NoSQL DB
        2. Data stored in Table, every table must has   2. Data stored as Collections, as JSON document
           rows and fixed column
        3. Uses a fixed schema                          3. Uses dynamic schema
        4. Support large number of Datatypes            4. Limited set Datatypes
        5. Uses for traditional bussiness app           5. Used in bigdata & real time app
    5. MongoDB can be used in different Environment
        - MongoDB Atlas : cloud version of MongoDB
        - MongoDB Enterprise : subscription based version self managed 
        - MongoDB Community : open source version
    6. MongoDB Shell / Mongosh : terminal where MongoDB commands are used
    7. Every document inside MongoDB has a unique key which is generated by MongoDB itself. it stored in "_id" and it value will be a string if hexadecimal numbers
    8. CRUD operations performed by MongoDB
        - find() : used to read all documents from a collection
        - findOne({"Key":value}) : used to read single document from a collection
        - insertOne({"Key":value}) : used to insert single document from a collection
        - insertMany({"Key":value}) : used to insert multiple document from a collection
        - countDocuments() : used to get total count of documents inside a collection
        - limit(count) : used to limit total document from a collection
        - skip(count) : used to skip document while getting them from a collection
        - sort({key:1/-1}) : used to sort document , if value is 1 then ascending order -1 then descending order
        - Querying Statements : used to get documents after applying query to collection. all querying Statements are precede by $ symbol. ex $gt,$gte,$lt,$lte,$eq,$neq,$exists,$regex. its syntax is {key:{querying-Statement : value}}
        - $expr : used to compare keys inside a document itself, syntax : {$expr:{querying-Statement:["$key1","$key2"]}}
        - updateOne({key:value},updated-Query) : used to update a single document from a collection, querying Statements in update query as $set,$push,$pull,$inc
        - updateMany({key:value},updated-Query) : used to update a multiple document from a collection
        - deleteOne({key:value}) : used to delete a single document from a collection
        - deleteMany({key:value}) : used to delete a multiple document from a collection
    9. Aggregation : used to join / combine two collection in a MongoDB DB
        - Using $lookup : similar to left-outer join
        {
            $lookup:
                {
                from: <collection to join>,
                localField: <field from the input documents>,
                foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
                as: <output array field>
                }
        }


            ---------  NODE JS - SERVER SIDE TECHNOLOGIES ---------

    1. Is an open source, cross platform runtime Environment to execute JS file outside the browser, create servers(used to resolve client request) in a web app
    2. Features
        - Extremely fast
        - Asynchronous function
        - Highly scalable
    3. Nodejs Global objects : Objects can be accessed through out node app without importing it. ex: process objects, environmental objects ( used to store secret / configuration data of a project )
    4. Nodejs Module system : used to share data between different file. it uses 'commonJSModule' system
        - for import : it uses require('file path / package-name')
        - for export : 
            - to export default : use module.exports keyword
            - to export : use exports keyword
    5. Predefined / Built in module 
        - fs Module : it consists of method for read/write data to a file in a system
        - http module : used to create server resolving http client request
        - https module : used to create server resolving https client request
        - events module : used to manage userdefined events
        - crypto module : used to protect data by encrypting
    6. Execution Model : Event driven model and non blocking I/O, optimised Asynchronous task
    7. API Access : access to system level API ( file system , network , process ) 
    8. Working Node js : used to resolve client request from a browser and send response to client browser while Working with single thread. 
        - Non blocking I/O
        - Asynchronous function
    9. Server Setup 
        - REST API - uses http Protocol ( GET , POST , PUT , DELETE)
        - JSON data should be passed via http request body
        - CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) Protocol used to enable data sharing between client & server
    
            ---------  EXPRESS JS - SERVER FRAMEWORK for Node js ---------
    
    1. uses for client-server Application , to create server with node js Features
    2. Steps to create express server for resolving client request
        - Create a folder for server Application
        - create package.json file insdide server folder : use a command : npm init -y
        - update script key of package.json file as "start":"node index.js" and remove test key from it
        - Install packages needed to create server : npm i express cors dotenv 
            - express package : npm i express - used to create express server
            - cors packages : npm i cors - used to enable cors Protocol
            - dotenv packages : npm i dotenv - used to load contain of .env file into process object
            - mongoose package : npm i mongoose - used to create and manage MongoDB document with Nodejs
        - create .env file for storing environmental variable of the project
        - create .gitignore file for adding file / foldername inorder to ignore them while adding to git
        - create main entry of server which is index.js file in server folder, used to define server
            - Steps to create express in index.js / nodemon index.js
                - import express , cors and dotenv
                - import db connection
                - create express server, which is capable of resolving client request
                - use cors in express server, used to enable data sharing between server and client app
                - use json parser insdie server app 
                - use mongoose package inside sever app
                - create PORT number for server app
                - listen server app in created PORT 
                - run server app to make express app available created port : use command in server terminal 'node index.js'
                - to http request using express server
                    - express-server.http-request(path,function with 2 arguements for request, response)
    3.MVC Architecture of Node Application
        - Controller : used to define logic to resolve client request
            - create a folder for controllers
                - create a js file for each controllers
                - define logic to resolve each request and export the same
                - import model in controllers
            - Routes : used to define route for each client request
                - create a folder for routes in server
                - create js file to define route / path / url where client can request
                - import express
                - create an object for router class of express
                - using router object we can define path in server app for client request
                - export the router object and use it in server app
            - DB Connection with server app 
                - install mongoose : npm i mongoose 
                - create folder inside server app
                - create js file to define db Connection
                - import mongoose
                - get mongodb atlas Connection string from .env
                - using mongoose Connect method establish Connection between server and mongodb
                - import connection file inside index.js to execute connection
            - Model : used to communicate Nodejs with DB 
                - create a folder inside server
                - create a js file to define model
                - import mongoose inside file 
                - using mongoose create schema /structure for data to be stored in model
                - create model using schema 
                - export model 
            - Middlewares : used to perform a task before executing its controllers
                - create folder insdide server
                - create js file to define middleware and export middleware
                - use middleware in specific router
            - Handling uploaded file in server
                - install multer : npm i multer
                - create a folder to store uploaded files in server folder
                - create js file to handling uploading file using multer in middleware folder
                - defining storage space for uploaded file and use the storage in multer function and it will return a multer instance which act as middleware
                - export the multer instance 
                - we will use multer middleware inside any router which handling uploaded file from request, multer middleware can handle single / multiple uploaded files
            - Exporting static file from as server to internet using node js : server.use(path,express.static('folder/file-path')) in index.js file

            ---------  MONGOOSE - NODE JS package used to communicate with MongoDB & Nodejs ---------
    
    1. ODM (Object Data Modeling) for MongoDB to Nodejs
    2. Mongoose library is used to create and manage MongoDB document with Nodejs
    3. Install mongoose : npm i mongoose 
    4. Schema : used to define structure of data to be stored in MongoDB, to create schema, create an object for mongoose schema class
    5. Model : similar to collection of MongoDB , model will communicate controllers of a node js appp
    6. CRUD operations using mongoose
        - to create / insert a data in mongoose model for that we have to create object for model and pass its arguement as data, to store model data permanently in MongoDB use mongoose 'save' method
        - read / get data : find() , findOne() , findById()
        - Update a data : updateOne() , updateMany() , findByIdAndUpdate()
        - Delete a data : deleteOne() , deleteMany() , findByIdAndDelete() 
    7. Querying Statements used in mongoose : skip() , limit() , sort()

        --------- JSON WEB TOKEN - USED TO AUTHORIZATION IN NODE JS  ---------

    1. JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. 
    2. Features
        - Authorization
        - Information Exchange
    3. structure of token : header.payload.signature
    4. To generate token :
        - install jsonwebtoken : npm i jsonwebtoken
        - import jsonwebtoken
        - use sign method to generate token : sign(payload,password)
        - payload : are used to store data inside the token
        - When user successfully login then generate token for Authorization
    5. Verify token : use verify method use token and password used to generate token
        - if token verified then we will get an object as response with data stored in token its payload
        - if token verification failed then we will get error

        --------- MIDDLEWARES - USED TO CONTROL REQUEST RESPONSE CYCLE OF NODE JS  ---------

    1. They are function with 3 arguements, first is request , second is response and third is next.
    2. Different types of middleware
        - Application specific middleware , ex: express.json()
        - Router specific middleware : active for certain Routes
             - create a function with 3 arguements

        --------- MULTER - Middlewares used to handle multipart/form-data in Nodejs  ---------

    1. Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency.
    2. Install multer : npm i multer
    3. Multer adds a body object and a file or files object to the request object. The body object contains the values of the text fields of the form, the file or files object contains the files uploaded via the form.
    4. Multer can stored uploaded file in server
